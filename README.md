Made a demo website using HTML and CSS. It features a header with social media icons, a main title with a welcome message, a large background image with overlay text and a subscribe button, and a two-column layout for blog posts and a sidebar. The sidebar includes the author's profile, popular posts, advertisements, tags, inspiration images, social media follow buttons, and a subscription form. The page uses various CSS styles to enhance the visual appeal and layout.
